## Project Setup

### Key Features
1. **Movie Details:**
   - View movie titles, descriptions, posters, and trailers.
2. **API Integration:**
   - Fetch movie metadata, posters, and trailers using an external API.
3. **UI Components:**
   - User-friendly interface designed with Material Design and ViewPager2 for smooth navigation.

## Libraries and Their Justifications

### Core Libraries
1. **Navigation Components (`androidx.navigation`):**
   - Manages app navigation between fragments.
   - Simplifies deep linking and back-stack handling.

2. **Lifecycle Components (`ViewModel`, `LiveData`, `runtime-ktx`):**
   - `ViewModel`: Handles UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner.
   - `LiveData`: Updates the UI automatically when data changes.
   - Ensures smooth handling of configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation).

### Networking Libraries
1. **Retrofit and OkHttp:**
   - **Retrofit:** Simplifies HTTP API calls for fetching movie data.
   - **Gson Converter:** Parses JSON responses into Kotlin/Java objects.
   - **OkHttp Logging Interceptor:** Logs HTTP requests and responses for debugging.

### Image Loading
1. **Glide:**
   - Efficiently loads and caches movie posters and images.
   - Handles image transformations with minimal memory usage.

### Video Playback
1. **YouTube Player (`androidyoutubeplayer`):**
   - Integrates YouTube videos for seamless trailer playback.
   - Provides features like full-screen mode and video controls.

### UI Components
1. **Material Design (`com.google.android.material`):**
   - Modern UI elements like buttons, toolbars, and navigation drawers for a polished user experience.

2. **Circle ImageView (`de.hdodenhof:circleimageview`):**
   - Displays circular images, such as actor photos or thumbnails.

3. **ViewPager2:**
   - Enables swiping between pages/fragments, ideal for browsing movie categories or recommendations.

## Build and Run Process

### Steps to Build the Project
1. **Ensure Environment Setup:**
   - Android Studio with SDKs for API level 24 (minimum) and API level 35 (compile and target).
   - Gradle version aligned with project configuration.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - All required libraries are declared in the `build.gradle` file.
   - Sync the project in Android Studio to download and configure dependencies.

3. **Parcelize Plugin:**
   - The `kotlin-parcelize` plugin is added for easier data transfer between components (e.g., fragments).

4. **Retrofit Configuration:**
   - Define API service interfaces for fetching movie data.
   - Configure API key and endpoint in your project.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Connect an Emulator or Device:**
   - Use a physical device or emulator running Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher.

2. **Launch the App:**
   - Build and run the app in Android Studio.
   - The app will load the home screen, fetch movie data, and display it.

3. **Debugging Tools:**
   - Use Logcat to identify and debug API response issues or UI glitches.
   - Verify API requests using the OkHttp logging interceptor.

## Potential Enhancements
1. **Search Functionality:**
   - Enable users to search for movies by title or keywords.

2. **Favorites/Bookmarks:**
   - Allow users to save and manage their favorite movies.

3. **Pagination:**
   - Handle large datasets from the API with efficient pagination.
